## Generic README for DISTRHO Linux Ports

This folder contains audio plugins downloaded from http://distrho.sourceforge.net/ports

The included *.lv2 folder is an LV2 bundle, copy it to ~/.lv2/ or /usr/lib/lv2/ so that LV2 capable hosts can see it.
~/.lv2/ is a hidden folder within your home, if it does not exist you can create it.
/usr/lib/lv2/ is a system folder and as such requires root permissions in order to copy files there.

The included *.so file is a VST plugin, copy it to ~/.vst/ or /usr/lib/vst/ so that VST capable hosts can see it.
As with LV2, ~/.vst/ is a hidden folder, create it if needed.


If your host is not listing these plugins, make sure the binaries you downloaded match your host architecture.
32bit plugins go into 32bit hosts, same for 64bit.
Some hosts are able to load plugins with different architecture, but that's the exception rather than the rule.
